    "Analysis of this dataset has yielded the following insights:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Almost 6x as many males died a gun-related death as females in the US between 2012 and 2014.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Overall, 40% more black Americans die as a result of a gun than white Americans.</li>\n",
    "    <li>White Americans are actually 26% more likely than Native American/Native Alaskans to die as a result of a gun, and 41% more likely than Hispanic Americans.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Black and Hispanic American gun deaths had a high likelihood of being ruled a homicide in this time period (83% and 65% respectively).</li>\n",
    "    <li>When a white American died as a result of a gun, it was ruled a suicide 84% of the time.  When it was a Native American/Native Alaskan who died, it was ruled a suicide 60% of the time.</li>\n",
    "    <li>For Americans on the whole, each additional educational achievement has an insulating effect against dying a gun-related death.  The effect is strongest for Black Americans who have completed College.</li>\n",
    "    <li>White Americans whose highest educational attainment is high school or below have a significantly lower rate of gun death than the national average - 40% lower if they have not completed high school, and 16% lower if they have.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Black Americans are 3x as likely to die a gun death as White Americans if both do not have high school, and twice as likely if they do.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Black Americans with a BA or higher are 35% less likely to die as a gun-related death as White Americans.  This may be a result of the preponderance of White American gun suicides.</li>\n",
